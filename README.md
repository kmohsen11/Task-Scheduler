# Task-Scheduler
This program is a task scheduler that utilizes a max-heap priority queue to prioritize tasks based on their priority values. The program accounts for various factors that affect the priority value such as task start time, dependencies, and duration. Tasks with fixed start times have higher priority than flexible-timed tasks, tasks with no dependencies have higher priority than tasks that depend on them, and tasks with longer duration have higher priority than shorter tasks. The priority value is re-calculated dynamically as new tasks are added to the queue to account for potential edge cases in real-life situations. The program guarantees that tasks will be executed in the correct sequence, but does not guarantee that tasks with fixed start times will begin at those times.
